## Guidelines

Contributions should be helpful and meaningful. Minor changes are not accepted if the do not fix errors or contribute value to the project.

* Check the open issues to see if there is a task open that you can work on

* Check the Pull Requests to make sure no one else has already done the work you plan on doing

* Don't submit PRs for work that is assigned to others

* Try to keep the code formatted nicely. You can use auto-formatters such as Prettier in VS-code to do this automatically.
